Backend Developer Task
Project Title: Notes API with Version History

Objective
Design and implement a FastAPI-based backend for a note-taking application with
version history.
The goal of this task is to assess your ability to:
●​ Architect a clean and scalable backend system.​
●​ Implement robust data modeling and schema design using PostgreSQL.​
●​ Handle version control logic for notes efficiently.​
●​ Document and test APIs with Postman.​
●​ Deploy and manage a production-ready backend service.​

This is an individual task and should be completed within 7 Days.

Core Requirements
1. Framework and Tools
●​ FastAPI (mandatory) for building all endpoints.​
●​ PostgreSQL (mandatory) as the primary database.​
●​ SQLAlchemy ORM for database interaction.​
●​ Alembic for database migrations.​
●​ Pydantic for schema validation and data serialization.​

2. Core Functionalities
a. User and Authentication
●​ Implement user registration and login.​
●​ Use JWT authentication for secure access to APIs.​
●​ Store passwords securely (hashed).​

b. Notes Management
●​ CRUD endpoints for notes:​
○​ Create a note.​
○​ Update note title/content.​
○​ Delete a note.​
○​ Fetch a single note or all notes belonging to a user.​
●​ Each note should include:​
○​ id, title, content, owner_id, created_at, updated_at.​

c. Version History
●​ Every time a note is updated, a new version should be stored automatically.​
●​ Each version must contain:​
○​ Note ID, version number, content snapshot, editor (user_id), and timestamp.​
●​ Provide endpoints for:​
○​ Listing all versions of a note.​
○​ Fetching a specific version.​
○​ Restoring a note to a previous version.​

d. Validation and Error Handling
●​ Apply schema validation to all inputs using Pydantic.​

●​ Return descriptive and consistent error messages.​
●​ Include appropriate HTTP status codes for each response.

e. Testing
●​ Include pytest tests for critical endpoints.​
●​ Cover CRUD operations, authentication, and version history retrieval.​
●​ Tests should validate status codes, data correctness, and authorization checks.​

3. Postman Documentation (Mandatory)
●​ Include a Postman collection covering all endpoints.​
●​ Each request must include:​
○​ Example input and output.​
○​ Auth token (for protected routes).​
○​ Descriptive request/response bodies.​
○​ Predefined Postman test scripts for validating key responses (e.g., status
= 200, correct data fields).​
●​ The collection should be easily importable and executable.
●​ Give access to the jmrpatel257@gmail.com and shubhammishralpu@gmail.com.​

4. Optional Enhancements (Bonus but appreciated)
●​ Frontend: Add a simple frontend to integrate all or partial APIs in NextJS.
●​ Collaborators: Allow multiple users to share and edit notes.
●​ Search and Filtering: Add endpoints for searching notes by title or content.
●​ Activity Logs: Track note access or edit actions.​

Deployment
1. Hosting
Deploy your backend on one of the following services:
●​ Render, Railway, Fly.io, or Azure App Service.​

2. Database
Host your PostgreSQL instance using:
●​ Neon, Supabase, or any of the free platforms of your choice.​

3. Deliverables
●​ The deployed backend should be live and publicly accessible.​
●​ The Postman collection should point to the live API.​

Deliverables Checklist
1.​ Private GitHub Repository containing:​
○​ Complete source code with modular structure.​
○​ Alembic migration scripts.​
○​ Postman collection (with examples and tests).​
○​ README including:​
■​ Setup and run instructions (local + production).​
■​ Environment variables.​
■​ API documentation summary.​
■​ Deployment URL.​

2.​ Access: Grant repository access to​
